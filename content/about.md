### Who Am I

Hi there!, I'm **Prince Raj**.

I'm developer first and later became the founder of [avnilabs.ai](https://avnilabs.ai). I like building things, especially with AI, and figuring stuff out as I go.

Most of my work sits around AI, products, and experiments. I'm less interested in buzzwords and more interested in what actually works in the real world. I enjoy taking rough ideas, breaking them a few times, and slowly turning them into something useful.

### What I'm Doing

Right now, I'm building at **Avni Labs**.  
The focus is simple: use AI to solve real problems without overcomplicating things.

I care a lot about:
- Practical AI (not just demos)
- Clean, simple products
- Learning by building instead of overthinking

I don't believe you need everything figured out before you start. You just need to start.

### How I Work

I learn fast, ship often, and adjust along the way.  
Most of my knowledge comes from trial and error, late nights, and curiosity.

I like working with people who:
- Are honest about what they don't know
- Think long-term
- Care about the details

### Outside of Work

When I'm not building, I'm usually:
- Reading or learning something random
- Thinking about startups and systems
- Having long conversations about ideas, tech, or the future
